  \item{sigdigs}{If one of the elements in print.mode is 'percent', then this is how many significant digits will be kept}
  \item{direct.area}{If this is equal to true, then the vector passed into area.vector will be directly assigned to the areas of the corresponding regions. Only use this if you know which positions in the vector correspond to which regions in the diagram}
  \item{area.vector}{An argument to be used when direct.area is true. These are the areas of the corresponding regions in the Venn Diagram}
  \item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed, including \code{margin}, which indicates amount of whitespace around the final diagram in npc units}
  }
\details{
The function defaults to placing the ellipses representing the areas 1 to 5 in a counterclockwise fashion.  Refer to the example below to see how the 31 partial areas are
ordered.  Arguments with length of 31 (label.col, cex, fontface, fontfamily) will follow the order in the example.
}
\value{
Returns an object of class gList containing the grid objects that make up the diagram.  Also displays the diagram in a graphical device unless specified with ind = FALSE.
Grid::grid.draw can be used to draw the gList object in a graphical device.
